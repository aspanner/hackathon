summary: "Let's deploy the first model across the hybrid cloud."
---

As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the ACME Financial Services data science team, who have been training models on their laptops.
The team have given you access to one of their models in the ACME Financial Services object storage and want to see how this could be deployed to a cluster running in the cloud.

## 3.1 - Examine your On-Premises and Cloud based storage

For this task, your team are required to use the `granite-7b-lab` model available in the object storage running in the ACME Financial Services on prem cluster which is based on Minio.

The `granite-7b-lab` model is available in the object storage running in the ACME Financial Services on prem cluster which is based on Minio. It's located under the `models` bucket.
After locating the model in on premises object storage, your team already replicated this model to the ACME Financial Services cloud cluster object storage (to a bucket and sub-folder under the same name) so that it could be served in future.

Examine both storage locations.

## 3.2 - Install  operators related to Openshift AI 

Now that you're aware of ACME's replication requirements their chosen model to their cloud OpenShift Cluster, it's time to do that replication and then serve the model ASAP.

For the first part of this challenge your team must demonstrate to ACME how to install OpenShift AI, replicate to the cloud and serve the existing model called `granite-7b-lab` via OpenShift AI.

Install the following opertors (do not install any custom resources)
- OpenShift AI
- OpenShift Service Mesh
- OpenShift Serverless


## 3.3 - Install OpenShift AI
Wait until the three operators specified in the previoius section have fully provisioned, before proceeding.
You won't need any Custom Resources for OpenShift Service Mesh and OpenShift Serverless

You will need one for OpenShift AI. A valid strategy would be to open the yaml view and go with all the defaults - the only addition to be to add this knative-serving-cert secret

```yaml
spec:
 components:
   kserve:
     managementState: Managed
     serving:
       ingressGateway:
         certificate:
           secretName: knative-serving-cert
           type: SelfSigned
       managementState: Managed
       name: knative-serving
```

## 3.4 - Set up your OpenShift AI project and workbench

An OpenShift AI project maps directly to an OpenShift project, enjoying the same RBAC and isoltion capailities.
OpenShift AI Workbenches pertain to a base container image, encapsulating a particular toolset used by the data scientists, e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow etc.

Now open OpenShift AI and do the following
- create a project
- create a workbench that 
  - uses Pytorch as a basis
  - uses a Large container size
  - uses a Persistent Volume of at least 100GB 
  - uses a Data Connection to your Minio object storage
  - uses a Medium sized Container without an accelerator

## 3.5 - Use your cloud-based OpenShift AI to Serve the model and make it easily consumable by intelligent applications for inference
Single Model Serving is the preferred mode for serving LLMs


### 3.5.1 - Single Model Serving
VLLM is a popular model server format whose APIs are compatible with Open AI (Chat GPT) APIs. This format then lends itself to easy migration of apps already using Open AI - to OpenShift AI.

Add a vLLM model server that uses a Data Connection that to your cloud cluster's Minio and the subfolder of its `models` bucket that contains your Granite model

### 3.5.2 - Make an inference call to your model

After perhaps 5 mins, your model server should be ready - with an Inference URL

You challenge is to make an inference API call. 

Free hint: the Fast API (Swagger) interface is a fast and effective way to do this

Free hint: no Authorisation or credentials should be necessary

2 more hints are available from the moderators
- Hint 3.5.2.1 - Fast API Inference URL
- Hint 3.5.2.2 - Specific Inference API endpoint and payload
